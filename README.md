HealthMon is a health monitoring system application created using the Flutter framework which is connected to a Firebase Cloud Firestore for database and Firebase Authentication for the login and signup features.

The application hosts three types of accounts which are the user, entrance monitor, and admin. All of the accounts have the base features such as creating a health entry and generating a building pass. On the other hand, certain features are only available to a particular account type: entrance monitor accounts are able to view logs, search student logs, update logs, and read generated QR. Meanwhile, admin accounts are granted the abilities for the following: viewing student accounts, viewing quarantined students, viewing students that are under monitoring, managing (approving or rejecting) students' requests, and elevating user accounts to admin or entrance monitor.
